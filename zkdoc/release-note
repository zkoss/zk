    the content and the application registers an onChanging listener.
    To disable it (and make it behave as 5.0.0), you can put the following
    in the zul file.
    <?script content="zk.afterLoad('zul.inp',function(){zul.inp.InputWidget.onChangingForced=false;})"?>

    org.zkoss.zk.ui.impl.MultiComposer
  * org.zkoss.zk.ui.WebApps's getEdition method returns EE, PE or CE.

* Upgrade Notes
  + Recompile your application since the return type of setAttribute 
    and removeAttribute of Execution, Session, and WebApp is changed 
	(to be the same as Component and Page and then implement the same 
	interface, Scope)
  + The attributes of the ID space of a space owner are the same
    the component attributes.
  + The namespace (org.zkoss.zk.scripting.Namespace) is deprecated.
    Rather, use the attributes directly.
  + Event processing thread is disabled by default. It means doModal
    will be degenerated to doHighlighted.
    To turn it on, specify the following in zk.xml:
   	<system-config>
		<disable-event-thread>false</disable-event-thread>
	</system-config>
  + The callback method of org.zkoss.zk.ui.util.ComponentCloneListener
    is renamed to willClone.
  + The signature of ClientConstraint is changed.
  + LanguageDefinition: getCompleteURI, getDesktopURI and getPageURI
    are replaced by getPageRenderer.
  + Mold URIs are no longer stored in ComponentDefinition.
    Rather, they are in a new class, WidgetDefinition.
  + Macro URI is no longer supported.
  + disable-behind-modal is deprecated (always false)
  + PageCtrl: addRoot, removeRoot, moveRoot, addFellow and removeFellow
    are removed
  + toolbarbutton is revised to look better in toolbar. Meanwhile,
    a new component called a is introduced for generate HTML A tag.
    Use it instead of toolbarbutton if HTML A is what you want
  + The client-side action has been replaced with the custom JavaScript
  	events.
  + Overlapped window in overlapped won't be cropped
    In older version, developers have to specify overflow:visible
  + The alphafix mold of image and imagemap is deprecated. They are handled
    automatically.
  + org.zkoss.zul.theme.enableZKPrefix is deprecated.
    Use the library properties, such as org.zkoss.zul.theme.fontSizeM,
    to use the same font for ZK and non-ZK content
  + org.zkoss.zul.Style's dynamic is deprecated since it is decided
    automatically
  + org.zkoss.zul.Applet and Iframe extends from HtmlBasedComponent
    rather than XulElement
  + The Z-class name of comboitem, bandpopup, groupfoot, listcell, listfoot,
	listfooter, listgroup, listgroupfoot, listhead, listheader, listitem,
	treecell, treechildren, treecol, treecols, treefoot, treefooter, treerow,
	table-children, and table-layout
	are renamed to be consistent with the component name. For example,
    z-combo-item is renamed to z-comboitem, and z-list-cell renamed to z-listcell.
  + The default mold of the button is changed as the os mold, and the default mold of the button
    in ZK 3.6.x called the trendy mold.
  + When instantiating a component manually, the component definition
    will be resolved from the language definition first, and then page
    definition if the definition in a page does not specify a class.
  + org.zkoss.zk.au.http.AuProcessor is replaced with
    org.zkoss.zk.au.http.AuExtension
  + fixedLayout property is deprecated in Grid/Listbox/Tree/. Use "sizedByContent" instead.
    Note that if you used to set fixedLayout=true, then you shall set sizedByContent=false 
	and if you used to set fixedLayout=false, then you shall set sizedByContent=true. By default, 
	the sizedByContent is false (i.e. fixedLayout is true).
  + By default, the constraint of the input elements is validated by client side, but you can specify
	it with 'server', for example, 'no empty, server', the constraint with 'server' would be validated
	by server side, if no error at client.
  + The meaning of hbox/vbox pack property is changed to follow XUL's spec. That is, "start" means 
    extra space is placed on the right/bottom side of the hbox/vbox, "center" means extra space is 
	split equally and placed on two sides(left and right/top and bottom of the hbox/vbox), 
	"end" means extra space is placed on the left/top of the hbox/vbox. If you would like the 
	hbox/vbox behaves just like in old version, you can add a "stretch" option on pack property to 
	make it backward compatible. i.e. "stretch,start", "stretch,center", or "stretch,end".
  + When the value specified in custom-attributes starts with "@{" and ends with "}",
    it is considered as an annotation.
  + Two extra methods are added to ThemeProvider for better control of
    the theme customization.
  + The JavaScript method called confirmRetry is renamed to zAu.confirmRetry
  + Encodes.URLEncoder is changed to allow the developer to encode in his
    own way. Furthermore, the configuration is by use of the library

	data binder in IdSpace scope as in 3.6.x, specify the following in zk.xml:

* Upgrade Notes:
  + error-uri will encode the URI, so don't need prefix it with the servlet
    context (refer to Bug 2877549)
  + Device.getTimeoutURI is deprecated. Use Configuration.getTimeoutURI instead.
  + When use data binding with selectedItem attribute of Listbox and/or Combobox, 
    data binder will fire "onSelect" event automatically when the page is first
	loaded or model is changed. This is not consistent with ZK specification: only 
	user action shall trigger component event. So since this version, no longer 
	the "onSelect" event will be fired(refer to Bug 2728704). However, some already
	implemented applications might count on such "side effects". Users can still 
	specify in zk.xml following libaray property to make it backward compatible.
	<library-property>
		<name>org.zkoss.zkplus.databind.onSelectWhenLoad</name>
		<value>true</value>
	</library-property>

* Upgrade Notes
  * The signature of doInit of org.zkoss.zk.ui.util.Initiator is changed.
    It is backward compatible if you prefer not to re-compile your codes.
    To upgrade, use args.get("arg0") instead of args[0]. However, it is
    suggested to have a better name for the argument, say, cookie, and then
    you can do
    	Object o = args.get("cookie");
    	if (o == null) args.get("arg0"); //backward compatible to old apps
  * About the issue when the overlapped component covers over the PDF file,
    the overlapped component will be in back of the PDF file, the fixed has been
    changed to specify the following code (Default, the IE6 browser will be taken)
  	<?script content="zk.useStackup = true;" ?>
  * org.zkoss.zk.ui.util.SessionSerializationListener is splitted to two
    interfaces: SessionSerializationListener and SessionActivationListener

* Upgrade Notes
  + The default setting disables the feature of ignoring the consecutive
	click events if it happens too close to the previous one
	(within 390 milliseconds).
	This feature is used to prevent the denial-of-service attack
	and the user's clicking twice before a long operation returns.
	However, it causes some confusion for the unit test
	(if the click rate is too high), so it is disabled by default.
	To enable it, specify the following in zk.xml.
	<client-config>
		<click-filter-delay>390</click-filter-delay>
	</client-config>

* Upgrade Notes
  + onBookmarkChanged is renamed to onBookmarkChange
  + The smartUpdate, response, onChildAdded, onChildRemoved and
    onDrawNewChid methods are moved from the Component interface
    to the ComponentCtrl intereface.
  + The setAutocheck and setChecked methods of Menuitem only apply
    when Menuitem.isCheckmark is true.
  + The script component now has "text/javascript" as the default type.
  + Add some new trendy layout of these components, including Borderlayout, Groupbox,
    Window, Menu, Menuitem, Menupopup, Menubar, and Menuseparator, as
    default mold. The ZK 3.0 customization won't work in ZK 3.5.
  + Both molds vertical and horizontal of Menubar are unsupported, please use
    the setOrient() of Menubar to specify them.
  + Change the layout of Paging component to a new trendy layout as default.
  + Rename from layout*.css.dsp to zkex*.css.dsp.
  + The method names of prototype and script.aculo.us embedded in ZK are
    renamed. It is transparent to developers since the backward compatibility
    is guaranteed.

	However, if you want your client codes to be comptible with other
	Ajax toolkit, it is recommended to use the new method names, such as
	zClass. In addition, you can have the following codes in your JavaScript
	files such that it is compatible with earlier ZK versions.
	if (!window.zClass) {
		zClass = Class;
		zDraggable = Draggable;
		zEffect = Effect;
		zPos = Position;
	}

  + org.zkoss.zkplus.databind.AnnotateDataBinderInit now implements both 
    org.zkoss.zk.ui.util.Initiator and org.zkoss.zk.ui.util.InitiatorExt interfaces.
    That is, the original interface method doAfterCompose(Page page) of Initiator
	won't be called any more. Rather, the doAfterCompose(Page page, Component[] comps) 
	of InitiatorExt is called. If you have written own class that extends 
	AnnotateDataBinderInit and overrides doAfterCompose(Page page) method of Initiator, 
	you probably have to do some modification accordingly.

* Upgrade Notes:
  + Window.setMode("modal") never suspends the execution even if called
    in an event thread. On the other hand, doModal() throws an exception
    if not called in an event thread.

  + <disable-behind-modal> is default to false.
    It improves the performance when opening a modal window.
    If you prefer it to true, specify the following in zk.xml.
	<client-config>
		<disable-behind-modal>true</disable-behind-modal>
	<client-config>

  + The CSS name called "inline-box" is renamed to "inline-block"

  + There is no line break before the content of a comboitem if
    it doesn't have the description. It is more flexible to customize
    the look (such as in single line). To be backward-compatible,
    specify the content to be "<br/>old content"

  + The spacing of separator and space is implemented by use of width
    and height. If you prefer to use margins like 3.0.3 or earlier did,
    specify the following in zk.xml
   	<system-property>
		<name>org.zkoss.zul.Separator.spaceWithMargin</name>
		<value>true</value>
	</system-property>

  + The leading and trailing whitespaces of labels are preserved.
    If you prefer to trim like 3.0.3 or earlier did,
    specify the following in zk.xml
   	<system-property>
		<name>org.zkoss.zk.ui.parser.trimLabel</name>
		<value>true</value>
	</system-property>

  + By default, the width of header of listbox/grid/tree includes
    the padding and margins defined in the style sheet (like ZK 2.4.1).
	If you want the width of header to exclude the padding and margins
	defined in the style (like ZK 3.0.3),
	please specify the follow CSS definitions in your CSS file.
tr.listbox-fake th, tr.tree-fake th, tr.grid-fake th {
	overflow: hidden; border: 1px solid;
	border-color: #DAE7F6 #9EB6CE #9EB6CE #DAE7F6;
	white-space: nowrap; padding: 2px;
	font-size: small; font-weight: normal;
}
tr.listbox-fake th.sort div, tr.tree-fake th.sort div, tr.grid-fake th.sort div{
	cursor: pointer; padding-right: 9px;
	background:transparent url(${c:encodeURL('~./zul/img/sort/v_hint.gif')});
	background-position: 99% center;
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
tr.listbox-fake th.sort-asc div, tr.tree-fake th.sort-asc div, tr.grid-fake th.sort-asc div {
	cursor: pointer; padding-right: 9px;
	background:transparent url(${c:encodeURL('~./zul/img/sort/v_asc.gif')});
	background-position: 99% center;
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
tr.listbox-fake th.sort-dsc div, tr.tree-fake th.sort-dsc div, tr.grid-fake th.sort-dsc div {
	cursor: pointer; padding-right: 9px;
	background:transparent url(${c:encodeURL('~./zul/img/sort/v_dsc.gif')});
	background-position: 99% center;
	background-repeat: no-repeat;

* Upgrade Notes:
  + The pageContext variable in EL expressions becomes an instance of
    org.zkoss.web.servlet.xel.PageContext
  + Initiator's doCatch() now returns a boolean to indicate whether to ignore
    the exception.
    Note: it is backward compatible that you don't need to re-compile your codes
  + In zk.xml, disable-default-theme is replaced with disable-theme-uri.
  + EventThreadInit's init() now returns a boolean to indicate whether
    to continue the processing of the event.
  + Throws an exception in EventThreadResume's afterResume() will stop
    the execution.
  + The look of a tree is now customizable by use of CSS. Refer to Java API.
    The icon-uri, icon-width and icon-height attributes are no longer used
  + If the hyphen property of label is true, it means the maximal allowed
    length of each line, rather than each word.
  + The org.zkoss.zk.au.impl package is renamed to org.zkoss.zk.au.cmd
    and Au* are moved from org.zkoss.zk.au to org.zkoss.zk.au.resp
  + The way to customize the zebra color (striping) of grid is changed.
    ZK 3.0 uses dual class names, grid and odd, to provide the style
    instead of renaming the class name to grid-od. Note: odd is the
    default value returned by getOddRowSclass(), which is customizable.
    Example,
	tr.odd td.gc {
		background: yellow;
	}
  + The way to customize a grid not to stripe rows is changed:
    <grid oddRowSclass="none">
  + el-config (of zk.xml) is replaced with xel-config, and the class
    must implement org.zkoss.xel.ExpressionFactory instead of
    javax.servlet.jsp.el.ExpressionEvaluator.
  + org.zkoss.zk.scripting.VariableResolver is removed.
    Use org.zkoss.xel.VariableResolver instead.
  + EL expressions specified in lang.xml and lang-addon.xml need to
    specify self to access a property.
  + org.zkoss.zk.scripting.Method is deprecated
    Use org.zkoss.xel.Function instead.
  + Page.getZScriptMethod() is deprecated.
    Use Page.getZScriptFunction() instead.
  + The onTimer event won't keep the session alive.
    To make it behave the same way as old versions, you can specify
	<session-config>
		<timer-keep-alive>false</timer-keep-alive>
	</sesion-config>
  + The signature of PageCtrl's init method is changed.
  + The signagure of ComponentInfo's applyProperties is changed
  + Utilities of JSP, such as JspLoaderServlet, are removed, since they are
    nothing to do with ZK
  + The signature of LanguageDefinition's contructor is changed.
  + About directives:
	New name are introduced though it is backward compatible with old versions:
	The component directive
		mold-name is renamed to moldName
		mold-uri is renamed to moldURI
		macro-uri is renamed to macroURI
	The page directive:
		script-language is renamed to scriptLanguage
  + About zk.xml:
    The disable-behind-modal, keep-across-visits, processing-prompt-delay
    and tooltip-delay elements are moved to the client-config element,
    though you still can specify them under the desktop-config element
    (because of the backward compatibility)
  + Device is shared by all desktops. The init method is changed.
    It is better to derive from GenericDevice.

* Upgrade Notes:
  + The ZK loader and filter compress the output if the browser supports the
  compression encoding. It may cause some side effect if you
  post-process the output of the ZK loader with a filter.
  You can turn it off to make the ZK loader not to compress as used to.
  Refer to the Developer's Guide for details.

* Upgrade Notes:
  + The isAsap method is abandoned. Rather, you have to implement
    org.zkoss.zk.ui.event.Deferrable if you want it to be deferrable listener.
    In other words, any event listener that returns false for the isAsap method
    shall implements Deferrable and returns true for the isDeferrable method.
  + The org.zkoss.zk.ui.sys.UiFactory interface adds a new method:
	public Component newComponent(Page page, Component parent,
	ComponentInfo compInfo);
  + LocaleProvider and TimeZoneProvider are removed.
    Use RequestIntercepter instead.
  + GenericInterpreter.getFromNamespace() returns UNDEFINED to denote
    a variable is not defined, while null is a valid value.
  + The timeout-uri element under the session-config element is deprecated.
    Riather, put it under the device-config element.
  + The 2.3 syntax for defining richlets is deprecated.
    Rather, use the richlet and richlet-mapping elements.
  + org.zkoss.zk.ui.http.ActivationListener is renamed to
    WebManagerActivationListener.
