  + Renaming icons for upgrading Font Awesome to 4.3

  	*. z-icon-resize-small to z-icon-compress

  + Removed the icons for upgrading Font Awesome to 4.3
  	*. z-icon-expand-o
  	*. z-icon-collapse-o
  + The library property of org.zkoss.zk.ui.invokeFirstRootForAfterKeyDown.enabled is false by default.
  + Deprecated the method of setWidgetAttribute() and getWidgetAttribute() of org.zkoss.zk.ui.Component, use
    setClientAttribute() and getClientAttribute() method instead.
  + Add a restriction that it's forbidden to set width/height/hflex/vflex in Auxheader.
  + Deprecated the method of setCheckable() and isCheckable() for Treeitem and Listitem component, use setSelectable() and isSelectable() instead.
  + The selectAll checkmark on listhead can support on Listbox with model in paging or non-paging mold, no matter whether in ROD or non-ROD mode.
  + The Selectable interface adds two new methods, setSelectionControl(SelectionControl) and getSelectionControl(), for select all function. By default
    it has a simple implementation for AbstractGroupsModel and AbstractListModel to assume all elements are selectable, if the default behavior is not
    the same as that in your application, please implement your own one to speed up the performane for a huge data model.
  + For Listitem and Treeitem component, if the value of isSelectable() or isCheckable() is false, it means the item cannot be selectable or navigable.
  + AbstractListModel and AbstractTreeModel now implements Pageable interface, recommend controling paging from model directly, instead of using component. If paging information was not set on model, when setting model to a component, model will inherit paging information from component. If model has its own paging information, when setting model to a component, paging information on the model will overwrite paging information on the component.

* Upgrade Notes
  + org.zkoss.zkplus.theme.StandardThemeProvider is deprecated, please use org.zkoss.zul.theme.StandardThemeProvider (for ZK CE),
  org.zkoss.zkex.theme.StandardThemeProvider (for ZK PE),
  org.zkoss.zkmax.theme.StandardThemeProvider (for ZK EE)
  + org.zkoss.zkmax.init.TabletThemeProvider is deprecated, please use org.zkoss.zkmax.theme.StandardThemeProvider instead.
  + org.zkoss.zkplus.theme.Themes is deprecated, please use org.zkoss.zul.theme.Themes instead.
  + To support ZK-1515, by default, folder-supplied themes are placed under <context-root>/theme/<theme-name>.
    Folder-supplied themes also need to be registered using Themes.register(themeName, Themes.ThemeOrigin.FOLDER) API. 
    If you want to change the default location, please specify the following setting in WEB-INF/zk.xml
    <library-property>
      <name>org.zkoss.theme.folder.root</name>
      <value>other/themes</value>
      <value>
    </library-property>
  + ThemeRegistry and ThemeResolver interfaces are introduced. Users could 
  implement these interfaces or extend the standard implementation to customize
  the theme registration and resolution process. To replace the defaults with the
  customized implementation, please add the following to WEB-INF/zk.xml.
    <desktop-config>
      <theme-registry-class>foo.CustomThemeRegistry</theme-registry-class>
      <theme-resolver-class>foo.CustomThemeResolver</theme-resolver-class>
    </desktop-config>
  + It is suggested to replace the default ThemeProvider, ThemeRegistry, and ThemeResolver in WEB-INF/zk.xml. Although not recommended, they could also be configured in metainfo/zk/zk.xml. Since multiple metainfo/zk/zk.xml could exist in the system, the loading order of these files makes it difficult to predict the final resulting configuration. To resolve this issue, in this version, it is now required to include <config-name> to identify the config, and an optional <depends> to specify the dependency relationship in metainfo/zk/zk.xml. Same as for metainfo/zk/config.xml in previous versions. For example,

    custom.jar:metainfo/zk/zk.xml
    <zk>
      <config-name>custom</config-name>
      <depends>zkmax</depends>
      ...
    </zk>

  This would ensure metainfo/zk/zk.xml contained in custom.jar would be applied after zkmax.jar.
  + In ZK EE, Themes.register() could be used to register tablet themes.
  Registration would need to prepend the theme name with the prefix "tablet:". For example,  to register a tablet theme called "dark", one
  would call Themes.register("tablet:dark") 
  + In previous ZK EE edition, custom themes were applied before the default tablet theme. Therefore, in order to override the default tablet theme, users may need to disable the default tablet theme first. In this version, custom tablet theme were distinguished from the custom desktop theme. Overriding default tablet themes means copying the default tablet themes in ~./zkmax/css/ to the custom tablet theme and modifying the part you want to override. Hence, the library property (org.zkoss.zkmax.tablet.theme.disabled) introduced previously for overriding default tablet theme is no longer required and is deprecated since this version.
  + In zkbind, an empty before|after command condition will get exception since this version, you should always provide a non-empty value for it or it means no-one can trigger it.

* Upgrade Notes
  + Decouple Flashchart component from zul.jar to flashchart.jar, due to Flashchart contains a potential
   SWF vulnerability in YUI 2 that the SWF files in question contain a cross-site JavaScript injection
   vulnerability which allows for the execution of arbitrary third-party code within the domain from which
   the files are served. Please download the flashchart.jar from the link instead - https://github.com/zkoss/flashchart
  + To support this feature ZK-1465 for reducing server loading, the comet server push will enable the smart connection setting
  by default, if you want to disable it as the previous version, please specify the following setting in the zk.xml.
   <library-property>
    <name>org.zkoss.zkex.ui.comet.smartconnection.disabled</name>
    <value>true</value>
  </library-property>
  Note: the smart connection is based on HTML5's page-visibility API, which is described - http://www.w3.org/TR/page-visibility/
  and it can only support on HTML5 browsers.

  ZK-844: IllegalStateException when use cdi DelegatingVariableResolver

* Upgrade Notes
  + The setFlex(String) API in org.zkoss.zul.LayoutRegion is deprecated, use setHflex/setVflex on child component instead.
  + The invocation of current @Init tagged method in a ViewModel class is moved from doAfterCompose() to earlier stage 
    doBeforeComposeChildren() in BindComposer, which means it's no longer applicable if you want to initiate your ViewModel 
    based  on host component scope (ex: child components and custom attributes) in an @Init tagged method. Instead you 
    should use @AfterCompose tagged method which is newly introduced since this version.
  + AnnotateBinder#init() will only take care of super#init(), you'll have to call AnnotateBinder#initAnnotatedBindings() 
    separately to initiate and register bindings based on ZUL component's annotation.
  + Deprecated all of the Hibernate utility classes in zkplus package, HibernateSessionContextListener.java, HibernateSessionFactoryListener.java,
    HibernateUtil.java, and OpenSessionInViewListener.java, please use official Hibernate's methods instead.

* Upgrade Notes
  + The default zclass of groupbox is renamed to z-groupbox, and the 3d zclass is
    z-groupbox-3d. In additions, the default mold is implemented with DIV rather than
    FIELDSET.
  + The default autowiring of HtmlMacroComponent and XmlMacroComponent is
    based on CSS 3 selector, i.e., it is the same as SelectorComposer.
    To be backward-compatible, you could specify a library property called
    org.zkoss.zk.ui.macro.autowire.convention to true.
  + zcommons-el.jar is not shipped with the binary distribution.
    Rather, zel.jar is shipped instead.
  + For ease of use, the return type of the following APIs are changed from Iterator
    to Iterable:
    org.zkoss.zk.ui.Exectuion: getHeaders and getHeaderNames
    org.zkoss.zk.ui.WebApp: getInitParameterNames
    org.zkoss.zk.ui.RichletConfig: getInitParameterNames
  + org.zkoss.zk.ui.util.Initiator.doAfterComposer(Page,Component[]),
    doCatch(Throwable) and doFinally() were removed.
    And, doCatch(Throwable) and doFinally() are moved to InitiatorExt
  + org.zkoss.zul.SimpleTreeNode and org.zkoss.zul.SimpleTreeModel are removed.
    They are replaced with org.zkoss.zul.DefaultTreeNode and
    org.zkoss.zul.DefaultTreeModel.
  + HTMLs, StyleSheet and JavaScript are moved to the org.zkoss.html package
  + org.zkoss.util.ListX, org.zkoss.util.TreeArray and org.zkoss.util.CheckableTreeArray
    are removed.
  + org.zkoss.zk.ui.api.*, org.zkoss.zul.api.* and all component related interfaces
    are removed.
  + Component's setVariable is removed (deprecated in 5.0). Please use
    Component.setAttribute(name, value, SPACE_SCOPE)
  + The addEventListner method of org.zkoss.zk.ui.Component won't check whether
    the same event listener is registered twice. In other words,
    it will be invoked multiple times if a listener is registered multiple times.
    If you want to ignore the second registration of the same listener
    (i.e., backward compatible with 5.0 or earlier), you could specify a library
    property called org.zkoss.zk.ui.EventListener.duplicateIgnored to true
  + The org.zkoss.zk.ui.event.Expression interface is deprecated, and replaced
    with the addEventListener(int, String, EventListener) (and priority as 1000).
  + The default constructors of org.zkoss.zk.ui.util.GenericForwardComposer
	and GenericAutowireComposer ignore the variables defined
	in zscript and XEL. If it causes problems, please use the construactor
	with full control (GenericAutowireComposer(separator,boolean,boolean)).
  + The getClassNames and resolveClass methods of org.zkoss.xel.FunctionMapper
    are removed. Rather, FunctionMapperExt are introduced, so you could implement
    both FunctionMapper and FunctionMapperExt to have the function.
  + The Window, Messagebox and Fileupload components won't throw InterruptedException.
    Rather, it is wrapped with UiException (because the event processing thread is
    deprecated)
  + UiFactory's newComponent method's signature is changed. Furthermore
    Two new methods are, newComposer and newServerPush, added to UiFactory
    to allow developers to customize the instantiation of a composer or 
    a server push implementation.
  + iZUML (client-side ZUML) supports only #{...}. It doesn't support ${...} any more.
    Notice ZUML (server-side) still uses the format of ${...}.
  + The org.zkoss.zk.ui.sys.SEORenderer.class perference is no longer supported.
    Please use the org.zkoss.zk.ui.sys.SEORenderer listener instead.
  + Tree's model rendering is deferred to the onInitRender event
  + AbstractComponent's newChildren() and newExtraCtrl() are both removed.
    Override getChildren() and getExtraCtrl() instead.
  + The template of Messagebox (~./zul/html/messagebox.zul) is changed.
    If you customize it, please refer to https://github.com/zkoss/zk/blob/6.0/zul/src/archive/web/zul/html/messagebox.zul
  + The event processing thread is deprecated and might be removed in the future
  + StubComponent's package becomes org.zkoss.zk.ui.sys.
  + EvaluatorRef's package becomes org.zkoss.zk.xel.
  + The hflex/vflex properties of a Panelchildren are determined by its parent
    Panel. The setter methods of Panelchildren's hflex/vflex will throw 
    UnsupportedOperationException. 
  + As the sizing of a few Grid/Listbox/Tree related components are controlled
    by others, the hflex and width properties of them are irrelevant. Their
    setters of hflex and width are deprecated. These components include:
    Treeitem, Treerow, Treecell, Treechildren, Treecols, Treefoot,
    Rows, Columns, Row, Cell, Foot, Listitem, Listcell, Listhead, Listfoot
  + The deprecated class org.zkoss.web.util.resource.ServletLabelResovler was removed.
  + No longer support ZKuery
  + Breeze has become the default theme. In other words, ZK 6 uses Breeze as the 
    default styling, without the need to include breeze.jar in the library
    directory on in Maven dependencies. Sapphire and Silvertail are packaged and 
    delivered as they were in ZK 5.
  + org.zkoss.zk.device.Device.isClient() is replaced with matches().
  + The support of comet is available to ZK PE, and it is
  	called org.zkoss.zkex.ui.comet.CometServerPush.
  	Meanwhile, org.zkoss.zkmax.ui.comet.CometServerPush is upgraded to support
  	Servlet 3 asynchronous processing. It will detect if Servlet 3 is supported,
  	and switch the implementation if necessary.
  + The default I18N  properties file is renamed from i3-label.properties to
    zk-label.properties.
  + The configuration file for logging is now configurable by use of
    the library property called org.zkoss.util.logging.config.file.
  + If the attribute called composerName is specified, the default name
    won't be wired (for better performance).
  + AbstractComponent.smartUpdate(String, Date) is removed
  + org.zkoss.zk.ui.sys.JavaScriptValue is moved to org.zkoss.json.JavaScriptValue
  + The return type of org.zkoss.zk.ui.metainfo.Annotation.getAttributes()
    is changed to Map<String, String[]>
  + Files.getConfigDirectory is removed
  + org.zkoss.util.logging.LogService is removed
  + org.zkoss.zul.ext.TreeSelectionModel and TreeOpenableModel are introduced
    to replace Selectable and Openable for TreeModel
  + The multiple status and the selection are provided by Selectable
    and TreeSelectionModel when using Listbox and Tree with Model.
  + The open status are provided by TreeOpenableModel when using Tree with Model
  + Library property org.zkoss.zul.Separator.spaceWithMargin is removed (since
    we don't maintain the margin approach found in ZK 2 any more)
  + The following classes are removed, since they are never used or introduce
    unnecessary complication.
    org.zkoss.web.util.resource.ClassWebServlet,
    org.zkoss.web.servlet.ForwardServlet, org.zkoss.web.servlet.http.HttpServlet,
    org.zkoss.io.PrintWriterX, org.zkoss.io.FileWatchdog,
    org.zkoss.media.Photo, org.zkoss.lang.WarningException, org.zkoss.lang.Warning,
    org.zkoss.util.InvalidValueException, org.zkoss.util.ModificationException,
    org.zkoss.util.ScalableTimer, org.zkoss.util.ScalableTimerTask,
    org.zkoss.util.ScalableTimerTask, org.zkoss.util.ThreadLocalCache
  + bullet1.gif, bullet2.gif and bullet3.gif are removed from zweb
    since they are never used
  + Some z-class names are changed:
    z-menu-item -> z-menuitem
    z-menu-popup -> z-menupopup
    z-menu-separator -> z-menuseparator
    z-panel-children -> z-panelchildren
  + Some CSS class names are changed. To update theme customization, replace CSS
    class occurrences by the following:
    .z-weekend -> .z-calendar-caldow .z-calendar-wkend
    .z-weekday -> .z-calendar-caldow .z-calendar-wkday
    .z-outside -> .z-calendar-outside
  + Selectable must be implemented  if a list model is assigned to a listbox.
  + Selectable introduced isMultiple and setMultiple methods.
  + ListModelExt and TreeModelExt are deprecated and replaced with
    org.zkoss.zul.ext.Sortable
  + GroupsModelExt is depreccated and replaced with
    org.zkoss.zul.ext.GroupsSortableModel
  + The render method of ListitemRender, RowRenderer, ComboitemRender and TreeitemRenderer
    has been changed: an additional argument called index was introduced.
  + Deprecated two methods isClose(int) and setClose(int, boolean) of org.zkoss.zul.GroupsModel.
	Replace with isGroupOpened(int), addOpenGroup(int) and removeOpenGroup(int)

    null and empty ("") as "auto" rather than the default spacing (i.e., "0.3em")
  + org.zkoss.zhtml.Text will encode the text by default. If it is not the case
    you want, please specify encode="fasle" to disable it.
  + Listheader's selectAll checkmark will disable when Listbox in ROD mode. Here
	is the feature tracker - http://tracker.zkoss.org/browse/ZK-220
  + If enable the autopaging function of Tree, Listbox, and Grid, the height of
	each row will be applied the following CSS by default. If you want to change
	the height, please overwrite the CSS rule as your preference.
.z-grid-autopaging .z-row-cnt {
	height: 30px;
	overflow: hidden;
}
.z-listbox-autopaging .z-listcell-cnt {
	height: 30px;
	overflow: hidden;
}
.z-tree-autopaging .z-treecell-cnt,
.z-dottree-autopaging .z-treecell-cnt,
.z-filetree-autopaging .z-treecell-cnt,
.z-vfiletree-autopaging .z-treecell-cnt {
	height: 30px;
	overflow: hidden;
}
  + iDOM is simplified and the concept of readonly and modification is removed.
  + The id-to-uuid-prefix configuration is removed
  + Add org.zkoss.zkplus.cluster.ClusterSessionPatch listener to zk.xml
  	enforcing GAE to write session states for each Ajax request

* Upgrade Notes
  + The default format of datebox and timebox becomes an empty string.
    To retrieve the real format, please use Datebox/Timebox's getRealFomrat() instead.
  + zk.Widget.smartUpdate() is disabled by default. If your client-side application
    depends on it, you have to turn on an attribute of the component called
    org.zkoss.zk.ui.updateByClient.
    If your component depends on it, you have to override AbstractComponent.updateByClient
    to handle it explicitly (please refer to JavaDoc API)

  + org.zkoss.zul.TreeModel is simplified: getPath is removed and getIndexOfChild
    is added (the same as javax.swing.tree.TreeModel).
    Notice it is backward compatible if you don't re-compile, or extend from
    AbstractTreeModel
  + org.zkoss.zul.Tree's getTreeitemRenderer and setTreeitemRender are deprecated
    and replaced with getItemRenderer and setItemRenderer

* Upgrade Notes
  + org.zkoss.zul.ArrayGroupsModel is deprecated and renamed to GroupsModelArray
    (such that the naming is consistent with ListModel's implementations)
  + zul.inp.Timebox is renamed to zul.db.Timebox (JavaScript)
  + For listbox and tree, if checkmark is enabled, clicking an item will toggle
    the selection rather than deselect all others.
    If you want to deselect all others (as 5.0.4 or ealier did), please
    specify true to library properties called
    org.zkoss.zul.listbox.checkmarkDeselectOthers
    and org.zkoss.zul.tree.checkmarkDeselectOthers
  + Autowire ignores the fields and methods declared in any class belong to
    org.zkoss.zul and org.zkoss.zhtml, because it is error-proning.
    However, if you want to wire them as 5.0.4 did, you could specify the library
    property called org.zkoss.zk.ui.wire.zul.enabled with true.
  + South and north's collapsed margins are changed from [5, 5, 5, 5]
    to [3, 0, 0, 3]
  + The DOM structure of the pagging component's os mold has been modified, 
	if you ever customized it, you might have to add the following CSS into your
	customization: 
	div.z-paging-os-cnt-l,
	div.z-paging-os-cnt-r,
	div.z-paging-os-cnt-m,
	div.z-paging-os-cnt-seld-l,
	div.z-paging-os-cnt-seld-r,
	div.z-paging-os-cnt-seld-m,
	div.z-paging-os-cnt-l-over {
		display: inline-block;
		*display: inline;
		zoom: 1;
	}
	.z-paging-os a.z-paging-os-cnt {
		margin-left: 3px;
		margin-right: 3px;
	}
  + Rename caption.css to caption.css.dsp
  + Rename tablelayout.css to tablelayout.css.dsp

* Upgrade Notes
  + The default value of tabindex is changed from -1 to 0.

    Listbox and derives.
  + By default, HtmlMacroComponent supports auto forward events and wire
    accessible variables.
    You can turn on/off auto wire mechanism by specifying the Library
    Property "org.zkoss.zk.ui.macro.autowire.disabled" to "true" in WEB-INF/zk.xml.
    If you did not specify the Library Property, default is false. 
    <library-property>
    	<name>org.zkoss.zk.ui.macro.autowire.disabled</name>
    	<value>true</value>
    </library-property>
   or turn on/off auto forward events by specifying the Library Property
   "org.zkoss.zk.ui.macro.autoforward.disabled" to "true" in WEB-INF/zk.xml.
   If you did not specify the Library Property, default is false.
    <library-property>
   		<name>org.zkoss.zk.ui.macro.autoforward.disabled</name>
    	<value>true</value>
    </library-property>
  + SimpleListModel's getSubModel returns an empty list if the value user entered
    is empty. In additions, inSubModel is added to simplify the overriding.
  + Specify type as submit to make a button to submit a form when clicked.
  + The protected _visible member of AbstractComponent is removed.
    Use setVisibleDirectly() instead.
  + The protected _left, _top, _width and _height members of HtmlBasedComponent
    are removed. Use setLeftDirectly(), setTopDirecty(), setWidthDirectly()
    and setHeightDirectly() instead.
  + AbstractComponent's newChildren() and newExtraCtrl() are both deprecated.
    Override getChildren() and getExtraCtrl() instead.
  + The class name of the engine of chart and captcha must be specified in
    the library properties called org.zkoss.zul.chart.engine.class and
    org.zkoss.zul.captcha.engine.class respectively.

    the content and the application registers an onChanging listener.
    To disable it (and make it behave as 5.0.0), you can put the following
    in the zul file.
    <?script content="zk.afterLoad('zul.inp',function(){zul.inp.InputWidget.onChangingForced=false;})"?>

    org.zkoss.zk.ui.impl.MultiComposer

* Upgrade Notes
  + Recompile your application since the return type of setAttribute 
    and removeAttribute of Execution, Session, and WebApp is changed 
	(to be the same as Component and Page and then implement the same 
	interface, Scope)
  + The attributes of the ID space of a space owner are the same
    the component attributes.
  + The namespace (org.zkoss.zk.scripting.Namespace) is deprecated.
    Rather, use the attributes directly.
  + Event processing thread is disabled by default. It means doModal
    will be degenerated to doHighlighted.
    To turn it on, specify the following in zk.xml:
   	<system-config>
		<disable-event-thread>false</disable-event-thread>
	</system-config>
  + The callback method of org.zkoss.zk.ui.util.ComponentCloneListener
    is renamed to willClone.
  + The signature of ClientConstraint is changed.
  + LanguageDefinition: getCompleteURI, getDesktopURI and getPageURI
    are replaced by getPageRenderer.
  + Mold URIs are no longer stored in ComponentDefinition.
    Rather, they are in a new class, WidgetDefinition.
  + Macro URI is no longer supported.
  + disable-behind-modal is deprecated (always false)
  + PageCtrl: addRoot, removeRoot, moveRoot, addFellow and removeFellow
    are removed
  + toolbarbutton is revised to look better in toolbar. Meanwhile,
    a new component called a is introduced for generate HTML A tag.
    Use it instead of toolbarbutton if HTML A is what you want
  + The client-side action has been replaced with the custom JavaScript
  	events.
  + Overlapped window in overlapped won't be cropped
    In older version, developers have to specify overflow:visible
  + The alphafix mold of image and imagemap is deprecated. They are handled
    automatically.
  + org.zkoss.zul.theme.enableZKPrefix is deprecated.
    Use the library properties, such as org.zkoss.zul.theme.fontSizeM,
    to use the same font for ZK and non-ZK content
  + org.zkoss.zul.Style's dynamic is deprecated since it is decided
    automatically
  + org.zkoss.zul.Applet and Iframe extends from HtmlBasedComponent
    rather than XulElement
  + The Z-class name of comboitem, bandpopup, groupfoot, listcell, listfoot,
	listfooter, listgroup, listgroupfoot, listhead, listheader, listitem,
	treecell, treechildren, treecol, treecols, treefoot, treefooter, treerow,
	table-children, and table-layout
	are renamed to be consistent with the component name. For example,
    z-combo-item is renamed to z-comboitem, and z-list-cell renamed to z-listcell.
  + The default mold of the button is changed as the os mold, and the default mold of the button
    in ZK 3.6.x called the trendy mold.
  + When instantiating a component manually, the component definition
    will be resolved from the language definition first, and then page
    definition if the definition in a page does not specify a class.
  + org.zkoss.zk.au.http.AuProcessor is replaced with
    org.zkoss.zk.au.http.AuExtension
  + fixedLayout property is deprecated in Grid/Listbox/Tree/. Use "sizedByContent" instead.
    Note that if you used to set fixedLayout=true, then you shall set sizedByContent=false 
	and if you used to set fixedLayout=false, then you shall set sizedByContent=true. By default, 
	the sizedByContent is false (i.e. fixedLayout is true).
  + By default, the constraint of the input elements is validated by client side, but you can specify
	it with 'server', for example, 'no empty, server', the constraint with 'server' would be validated
	by server side, if no error at client.
  + The meaning of hbox/vbox pack property is changed to follow XUL's spec. That is, "start" means 
    extra space is placed on the right/bottom side of the hbox/vbox, "center" means extra space is 
	split equally and placed on two sides(left and right/top and bottom of the hbox/vbox), 
	"end" means extra space is placed on the left/top of the hbox/vbox. If you would like the 
	hbox/vbox behaves just like in old version, you can add a "stretch" option on pack property to 
	make it backward compatible. i.e. "stretch,start", "stretch,center", or "stretch,end".
  + When the value specified in custom-attributes starts with "@{" and ends with "}",
    it is considered as an annotation.
  + Two extra methods are added to ThemeProvider for better control of
    the theme customization.
  + The JavaScript method called confirmRetry is renamed to zAu.confirmRetry
  + Encodes.URLEncoder is changed to allow the developer to encode in his
    own way. Furthermore, the configuration is by use of the library
    property called org.zkoss.web.servlet.http.URLEncoder.
  + Two extra methods are added to org.zkoss.zul.XYModel for better control (insert and replace value
    at a specified index) of the series value.
  + Two extra methods are added to org.zkoss.zul.XYZModel for better control (insert and replace value
    at a specified index) of the series value.
  + Two extra methods are added to org.zkoss.zul.HiLoModel for better control (insert and replace value
    at a specified index).
  + EventQueue is not part of ZK CE. Use org.zkoss.zk.ui.event.EventQueues
    and org.zkoss.zk.ui.event.EventQueue instead.
  + PortalMoveEvent is moved to the org.zkoss.zkmax.ui.event package
  + Tabpanels and Tabpanel won't be created automatically by default, if the size is inconsistent.
  + org.zkoss.zkplus.databind.AnnotateDataBinderInit used to store created data binder with name 
    "binder" in IdSpace scope of the covered root component but now it is stored at the custom 
	attributes of the covered root component or page. To make it backward compatible and store created 
	data binder in IdSpace scope as in 3.6.x, specify the following in zk.xml:
	<library-property>
		<name>org.zkoss.zkplus.databind.AnnotateDataBinderInit.compatible</name>
		<value>true</value>
	</library-property>
  + org.zkoss.zk.ui.impl.Attributes is deprecated and replaced with
    org.zkoss.zk.ui.sys.Attributes

* Upgrade Notes:
  + error-uri will encode the URI, so don't need prefix it with the servlet
    context (refer to Bug 2877549)
  + Device.getTimeoutURI is deprecated. Use Configuration.getTimeoutURI instead.
  + When use data binding with selectedItem attribute of Listbox and/or Combobox, 
    data binder will fire "onSelect" event automatically when the page is first
	loaded or model is changed. This is not consistent with ZK specification: only 
	user action shall trigger component event. So since this version, no longer 
	the "onSelect" event will be fired(refer to Bug 2728704). However, some already
	implemented applications might count on such "side effects". Users can still 
	specify in zk.xml following libaray property to make it backward compatible.
	<library-property>
		<name>org.zkoss.zkplus.databind.onSelectWhenLoad</name>
		<value>true</value>
	</library-property>

* Upgrade Notes
  * The signature of doInit of org.zkoss.zk.ui.util.Initiator is changed.
    It is backward compatible if you prefer not to re-compile your codes.
    To upgrade, use args.get("arg0") instead of args[0]. However, it is
    suggested to have a better name for the argument, say, cookie, and then
    you can do
    	Object o = args.get("cookie");
    	if (o == null) args.get("arg0"); //backward compatible to old apps
  * About the issue when the overlapped component covers over the PDF file,
    the overlapped component will be in back of the PDF file, the fixed has been
    changed to specify the following code (Default, the IE6 browser will be taken)
  	<?script content="zk.useStackup = true;" ?>
  * org.zkoss.zk.ui.util.SessionSerializationListener is splitted to two
    interfaces: SessionSerializationListener and SessionActivationListener

* Upgrade Notes
  + The default setting disables the feature of ignoring the consecutive
	click events if it happens too close to the previous one
	(within 390 milliseconds).
	This feature is used to prevent the denial-of-service attack
	and the user's clicking twice before a long operation returns.
	However, it causes some confusion for the unit test
	(if the click rate is too high), so it is disabled by default.

* Upgrade Notes
  + onBookmarkChanged is renamed to onBookmarkChange
  + The smartUpdate, response, onChildAdded, onChildRemoved and
    onDrawNewChid methods are moved from the Component interface
    to the ComponentCtrl intereface.
  + The setAutocheck and setChecked methods of Menuitem only apply
    when Menuitem.isCheckmark is true.
  + The script component now has "text/javascript" as the default type.
  + Add some new trendy layout of these components, including Borderlayout, Groupbox,
    Window, Menu, Menuitem, Menupopup, Menubar, and Menuseparator, as
    default mold. The ZK 3.0 customization won't work in ZK 3.5.
  + Both molds vertical and horizontal of Menubar are unsupported, please use
    the setOrient() of Menubar to specify them.
  + Change the layout of Paging component to a new trendy layout as default.
  + Rename from layout*.css.dsp to zkex*.css.dsp.
  + The method names of prototype and script.aculo.us embedded in ZK are
    renamed. It is transparent to developers since the backward compatibility
    is guaranteed.

	However, if you want your client codes to be comptible with other
	Ajax toolkit, it is recommended to use the new method names, such as
	zClass. In addition, you can have the following codes in your JavaScript
	files such that it is compatible with earlier ZK versions.
	if (!window.zClass) {
		zClass = Class;
		zDraggable = Draggable;
		zEffect = Effect;
		zPos = Position;
	}

  + org.zkoss.zkplus.databind.AnnotateDataBinderInit now implements both 
    org.zkoss.zk.ui.util.Initiator and org.zkoss.zk.ui.util.InitiatorExt interfaces.
    That is, the original interface method doAfterCompose(Page page) of Initiator
	won't be called any more. Rather, the doAfterCompose(Page page, Component[] comps) 
	of InitiatorExt is called. If you have written own class that extends 
	AnnotateDataBinderInit and overrides doAfterCompose(Page page) method of Initiator, 
	you probably have to do some modification accordingly.

* Upgrade Notes:
  + Window.setMode("modal") never suspends the execution even if called
    in an event thread. On the other hand, doModal() throws an exception
    if not called in an event thread.

  + <disable-behind-modal> is default to false.
    It improves the performance when opening a modal window.
    If you prefer it to true, specify the following in zk.xml.
	<client-config>
		<disable-behind-modal>true</disable-behind-modal>
	<client-config>

  + The CSS name called "inline-box" is renamed to "inline-block"

  + There is no line break before the content of a comboitem if
    it doesn't have the description. It is more flexible to customize
    the look (such as in single line). To be backward-compatible,
    specify the content to be "<br/>old content"

  + The spacing of separator and space is implemented by use of width
    and height. If you prefer to use margins like 3.0.3 or earlier did,
    specify the following in zk.xml
   	<system-property>
		<name>org.zkoss.zul.Separator.spaceWithMargin</name>
		<value>true</value>
	</system-property>

  + The leading and trailing whitespaces of labels are preserved.
    If you prefer to trim like 3.0.3 or earlier did,
    specify the following in zk.xml
   	<system-property>
		<name>org.zkoss.zk.ui.parser.trimLabel</name>
		<value>true</value>
	</system-property>

  + By default, the width of header of listbox/grid/tree includes
    the padding and margins defined in the style sheet (like ZK 2.4.1).
	If you want the width of header to exclude the padding and margins
	defined in the style (like ZK 3.0.3),
	please specify the follow CSS definitions in your CSS file.
tr.listbox-fake th, tr.tree-fake th, tr.grid-fake th {
	overflow: hidden; border: 1px solid;
	border-color: #DAE7F6 #9EB6CE #9EB6CE #DAE7F6;
	white-space: nowrap; padding: 2px;
	font-size: small; font-weight: normal;
}
tr.listbox-fake th.sort div, tr.tree-fake th.sort div, tr.grid-fake th.sort div{
	cursor: pointer; padding-right: 9px;
	background:transparent url(${c:encodeURL('~./zul/img/sort/v_hint.gif')});
	background-position: 99% center;
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
tr.listbox-fake th.sort-asc div, tr.tree-fake th.sort-asc div, tr.grid-fake th.sort-asc div {
	cursor: pointer; padding-right: 9px;
	background:transparent url(${c:encodeURL('~./zul/img/sort/v_asc.gif')});
	background-position: 99% center;
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
tr.listbox-fake th.sort-dsc div, tr.tree-fake th.sort-dsc div, tr.grid-fake th.sort-dsc div {
	cursor: pointer; padding-right: 9px;
	background:transparent url(${c:encodeURL('~./zul/img/sort/v_dsc.gif')});
	background-position: 99% center;
	background-repeat: no-repeat;

* Upgrade Notes:
  + The pageContext variable in EL expressions becomes an instance of
    org.zkoss.web.servlet.xel.PageContext
  + Initiator's doCatch() now returns a boolean to indicate whether to ignore
    the exception.
    Note: it is backward compatible that you don't need to re-compile your codes
  + In zk.xml, disable-default-theme is replaced with disable-theme-uri.
  + EventThreadInit's init() now returns a boolean to indicate whether
    to continue the processing of the event.
  + Throws an exception in EventThreadResume's afterResume() will stop
    the execution.
  + The look of a tree is now customizable by use of CSS. Refer to Java API.
    The icon-uri, icon-width and icon-height attributes are no longer used
  + If the hyphen property of label is true, it means the maximal allowed
    length of each line, rather than each word.
  + The org.zkoss.zk.au.impl package is renamed to org.zkoss.zk.au.cmd
    and Au* are moved from org.zkoss.zk.au to org.zkoss.zk.au.resp
  + The way to customize the zebra color (striping) of grid is changed.
    ZK 3.0 uses dual class names, grid and odd, to provide the style
    instead of renaming the class name to grid-od. Note: odd is the
    default value returned by getOddRowSclass(), which is customizable.
    Example,
	tr.odd td.gc {
		background: yellow;
	}
  + The way to customize a grid not to stripe rows is changed:
    <grid oddRowSclass="none">
  + el-config (of zk.xml) is replaced with xel-config, and the class
    must implement org.zkoss.xel.ExpressionFactory instead of
    javax.servlet.jsp.el.ExpressionEvaluator.
  + org.zkoss.zk.scripting.VariableResolver is removed.
    Use org.zkoss.xel.VariableResolver instead.
  + EL expressions specified in lang.xml and lang-addon.xml need to
    specify self to access a property.
  + org.zkoss.zk.scripting.Method is deprecated
    Use org.zkoss.xel.Function instead.
  + Page.getZScriptMethod() is deprecated.
    Use Page.getZScriptFunction() instead.
  + The onTimer event won't keep the session alive.
    To make it behave the same way as old versions, you can specify
	<session-config>
		<timer-keep-alive>false</timer-keep-alive>
	</sesion-config>
  + The signature of PageCtrl's init method is changed.
  + The signagure of ComponentInfo's applyProperties is changed
  + Utilities of JSP, such as JspLoaderServlet, are removed, since they are
    nothing to do with ZK
  + The signature of LanguageDefinition's contructor is changed.
  + About directives:
	New name are introduced though it is backward compatible with old versions:
	The component directive
		mold-name is renamed to moldName
		mold-uri is renamed to moldURI
		macro-uri is renamed to macroURI
	The page directive:
		script-language is renamed to scriptLanguage
  + About zk.xml:
    The disable-behind-modal, keep-across-visits, processing-prompt-delay
    and tooltip-delay elements are moved to the client-config element,
    though you still can specify them under the desktop-config element
    (because of the backward compatibility)
  + Device is shared by all desktops. The init method is changed.
    It is better to derive from GenericDevice.

  compression encoding. It may cause some side effect if you
  post-process the output of the ZK loader with a filter.
  You can turn it off to make the ZK loader not to compress as used to.
  Refer to the Developer's Guide for details.

    In other words, any event listener that returns false for the isAsap method
    shall implements Deferrable and returns true for the isDeferrable method.
  + The org.zkoss.zk.ui.sys.UiFactory interface adds a new method:
	public Component newComponent(Page page, Component parent,
	ComponentInfo compInfo);
  + LocaleProvider and TimeZoneProvider are removed.
    Use RequestIntercepter instead.
  + GenericInterpreter.getFromNamespace() returns UNDEFINED to denote
    a variable is not defined, while null is a valid value.
  + The timeout-uri element under the session-config element is deprecated.
    Riather, put it under the device-config element.
  + The 2.3 syntax for defining richlets is deprecated.
    Rather, use the richlet and richlet-mapping elements.
  + org.zkoss.zk.ui.http.ActivationListener is renamed to
    WebManagerActivationListener.
