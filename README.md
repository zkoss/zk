##[Product Overview](http://www.zkoss.org/product/zk)

###Simply Java

> ZK is renowned for its "Ajax without JavaScript" approach since 2005,
> enabling developers to build rich internet applications transparently
> without any knowledge of Ajax and JavaScript.

> The client engine and update engine in ZK play the roles of pitcher and
> catcher, rendering Ajax communication transparent to developers. Events
> triggered by users are encapsulated and marshalled to event listeners
> running at the server.

> User interface rendered on browsers are surrogated on the server as
> POJO components, alternation made on the POJO components are reflected
> to the client transparently.

> With programs executed at the server, developers can leverage all the Java
> technologies, such as Java EE and Spring, while back-end data and services
> are readily available.


###Server+client Fusion

> ZK's Server+client Fusion gives developers the freedom to leverage the best
> of both sides.

> The server-centric solution to Ajax brings a productivity boost, robustness,
> and security to Web application development; while client side solutions
> endows Web applications with greater controllability and the ability to
> leverage client side resources.

> ZK marries the benefits of both to bring forth a developer-centric approach
> where developers continue to build large scale enterprise applications with
> all the robustness of Java technologies, but also are offered the flexibility
> to work directly with ZK's jQuery based widgets to further enhance user
> experience.
