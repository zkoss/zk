		Reproduce in multi-threads
		1. visit zul with chrome and stop at breakpoint A (ExValue#setExpectedType: _expr = null). This is thread A.
		2. visit zul with another browser (firefox) and stop at breakpoint B (ExValue#getValue(Evaluator eval, Component comp): init), step to next line. This is thread B.
		3. You should see thread A also processing into the init function, which means race condition disappear.
