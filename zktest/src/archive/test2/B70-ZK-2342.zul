	Reproducing steps: (Firefox only)

1. Select a listitem
2. Scroll down until rod kicked in
3. Scroll up and down rapidly while rod is still loading data
4. Click a few times at random position inside listbox while rod is still loading data
5. Observe in network tab of browser's developer tool
-> look for large post body and it would contain many onAnchorPos events (more than 10 times) with similar anchor positions (If true, that's a bug)
